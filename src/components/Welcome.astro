        About me
    </h2>
    <p>
        I’m a software engineer passionate about building scalable, efficient, and high-performing web
        applications that seamlessly integrate innovative design with robust functionality.
        My favorite work is creating dynamic user experiences backed by solid architecture,
        ensuring performance, usability, and scalability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I’m a Software Engineer at Hyphen, where I lead the development of new features and
        optimize existing functionalities using Laravel 11 and Vue 3. I focus on crafting responsive
        user interfaces, integrating advanced state management, and leveraging cloud services to deliver secure,
        modern solutions that meet business objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the past decade, I’ve had the opportunity to work in diverse environments—from large corporations
        to freelance projects and academic institutions. I’ve developed APIs, implemented real-time updates,
        and designed intuitive user interfaces across industries, all while embracing Agile methodologies and
        modern development practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of work, you’ll often find me exploring new programming languages, diving into mathematics,
        or spending time with my family in Miami. I’m driven by a passion for continuous learning and love
        collaborating on innovative projects that push the boundaries of web development.
